# LINEAR_PROGRAMMING
Supply Planning using Linear Programming with Python

 Problem Statement
  
As a Supply Planning manager of a mid-size manufacturing company, you received the feedback that the distribution costs are too high. Based on the analysis of the Transportation Manager this is mainly due to the stock allocation rules.

In some cases, your customers are not shipped by the closest distribution centre, which impacts your freight costs.

Your Distribution Network 

2 plants producing products with infinite capacity Note: weâ€™ll see later how we can improve this assumption easily
2 distribution centres that receive finished goods from the two plants and deliver them to the final customers Note: we will consider that these warehouses operate X-Docking to avoid considering the concept of stock capacity in our model 200 stores (delivery points)

Question

Which Plant i and Distribution n should I chose to produce and deliver 100 units to Store p at the lowest cost?
